## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-plant-disease-detector.git
cd ai-plant-disease-detector
```

### 2️⃣ Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv tfenv
tfenv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a leaf image
2. Image is resized and normalized
3. CNN model predicts disease class
4. Result + confidence displayed on UI
